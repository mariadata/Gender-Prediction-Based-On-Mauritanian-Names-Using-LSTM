# Gender-Prediction-Based-On-Mauritanian-Names-Using-LSTM
This project aims to predict the gender of mauritanian baccalaureate candidates since this information isn't 
available in the results excel file provided by the Mauritanian Ministry of Education. \
The model provided was trained on a dataset of mauritanian names and reached an accuracy of 97%. \
Feel free to use it if you want to save time and effort on adding a gender column to your own dataset :)
